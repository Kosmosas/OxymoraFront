		<p> 
		<ol>
			<li>
				Swimming while drunk or under the influence of other drugs is not allowed, epecially at night time. In the worst case, you have to bring a sober friend with you. There will be no lifeguards. YOU YOURSELF ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
			</li>
			<li>
				Making a campfire at a spot not intended for that is forbidden. There will be a lot of campfire spots available, you will definitely be able to find one.
				<ol>
					<li>
						If a camfire is not lit and you choose to do that, you are responsible for it automatically - you have to extinguish it before you leave.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Use garbage cans (there will be plenty)</li>
			<li>Be kind to your fellow participants (as well as yourself). Aggressive, hateful or foolish behavior will not be tolerated, you will be removed from the festival territory without further explanation.</li>
			<li>No partying at the parking area. Misbehavior will be reported by the parking site owner on duty. There will be enough space inside the festival territory. </li>
			<li>No glass containers (bottles, jars, etc). Use plastic containers instead.</li>
